/**

\page nvme_io_submission NVMe I/O Submission

I/O is submitted to an NVMe namespace using nvme_ns_cmd_xxx functions
defined in nvme_ns_cmd.c.  The NVMe driver submits the I/O request
as an NVMe submission queue entry on the queue pair specified in the command.
The application must poll for I/O completion on each queue pair with outstanding I/O
to receive completion callbacks.
